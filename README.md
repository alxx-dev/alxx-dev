## Welcome to alxx.dev

### `[ About Us ]`
**alxx.dev** is an AI company focused on building practical automation systems, intelligent agents, and custom AI tools that actually improve daily life.
**The mission** is to develop AI that delivers tools making learning, work, and productivity more efficient, accessible, and genuinely useful.
